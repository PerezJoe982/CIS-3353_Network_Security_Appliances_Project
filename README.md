# CIS-3353_Network_Security_Appliances_Project
Project for CIS-3352

This project was done with the contributions of Jimmy Aragon, Joe Perez, and Joshua Ibarra. For the project, we tested 3 different malware against the McAfee, Windows Defender, and BitDefender firewalls and antivirus and reported on how each one responded to the malware when they were downloaded and executed. Included in this repository is a report detailing the procedures the we took in order to conduct the tests and outcomes that resulted from them in addition to a timeline of the work that was done during the development and competition of this project.
